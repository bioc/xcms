2007-09-17: 1.9.6
rawEIC uses binary search
findMZBoxes gives proper error messages
findPeaks.centWave
  - new baseline and S/N estimation (default snthresh=20)
Bugfix for MSW.getRidge

2007-09-04: 1.9.5
Fixed bug were fillPeaks() would fail if there was <= 1 peak to fill in
Made getPeaks() slightly more memory efficient by correcting an oversight
flush.console() is now called on all systems during long operations

2007-07-16: 1.9.4
Increased buffer size to 100000 in findMZBoxes() to handle also files with a vast number of peaks
Fixed bug in MSW.getRidge() to catch empty ridgeLists
findPeaks.centWave
  - The scale on which the peak was localised is also returned
  - additional logical argument fitgauss, gaussian fits are no longer mandatory 
  - Integration method can be choosen: descent on the mexican hat filtered data or on the real data. Method 2 is honest, 
    while method 1 (default) is more robust to noise.
  - runs much faster 

2007-06-29: 1.9.3
Added wrapper for MassSpecWavelet peak picking on single spectra (findPeaks.MSW)

2007-05-??: 1.9.1

Workaround for ramp/gcc bug (optimization lowered to -O1 for ramp.c)
Several improvements for findpeaks.centWave

Updated ramp.c to v1.38 (from CVS)

2007-04-26: 1.8.0 & 1.9.0

introduced namespace
plot(xcmsEIC) problem seems to be fixed

Added : 
  - rawEIC method
  - findMZBoxes method
  - findPeaks.centWave method
Modified findPeaks() method to support different findPeaks.* algorithms

RAMP: updated ramp.c (v1.37), ramp.h  (from CVS)
  - ...
  - handle mzData "TimeInSeconds" values
  - dealing with mzXML files with missing scans
  - support for zlib compression
  
Check if file exists in xcmsRaw()
Plot (log) colored data points in plotRaw()  

Modified findPeaks method:
  - Moved column "i" (peak number within combined EIC) to the second-to-last column
  - Added column "sn" with signal to noise ratio
xcmsSets now include "i" and "sn" columns in the peaks matrix

Updated Windows NetCDF library to version 3.6.2 (now statically linked into xcms.dll)

Small fixes to xcmsSet generation relating to finding/categorizing files:
  - If the files argument is not set, then "./" is no longer appended
  - One character directory names, and thus group names, are now supported

Enabled axis labels for OpenGL surface plotting using plotSurf()
